# miMatch: A microbial metabolic background matching tool bolstering the causal link between microbiota and human disease in metagenomics

We developed a novel microbial metabolic background matching tool, namely miMatch (https://github.com/ddhmed/miMatch), to match microbial case and control samples, thereby strengthening the causality of metagenomics research.
